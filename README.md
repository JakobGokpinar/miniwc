# miniwc (C + ARM64 Assembly)

Small stream-processing program written in C with a hand-written ARM64
assembly counter.

## Purpose
- Practice C memory and I/O semantics
- Understand C ↔ Assembly ABI
- Work with raw byte streams (`read`)
- Verify compiler optimizations

This project was built as a pre-IN3000 warm-up.
